---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satya00089/diagrammatic.git
cd diagrammatic
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit 👉 [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 4️⃣ (Optional) Setup Authentication

To enable user authentication and cloud diagram storage:

1. **Get Google OAuth Client ID** (optional for Google Sign-In):
   - Follow the guide in [docs/GOOGLE_SIGNIN.md](docs/GOOGLE_SIGNIN.md)
   - Add to `.env`: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com`

2. **Setup Backend API**:
   - See [docs/FASTAPI_BACKEND.md](docs/FASTAPI_BACKEND.md) for complete backend setup
   - Add to `.env`: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in project root
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

> **Note**: The app works perfectly without authentication. Auth is only needed for saving/loading diagrams to the cloud.

### 5️⃣ Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```
